When a hook command name contains dots, convert it to the matching skill name by replacing dots with hyphens.
Example: `speckit.aisdlc.preflight` -> `$speckit-aisdlc-preflight`.

# Update Coding Agent Context

Refresh the managed Spec Kit section inside the active coding agent's context/instruction file (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`).

## Behavior

The script reads the agent-context extension config at
`.specify/extensions/agent-context/agent-context-config.yml` to discover:

- `context_file` — the path of the coding agent context file to manage.
- `context_files` — optional project-relative paths for multiple coding agent context files. When non-empty, the script updates each listed file and the list takes precedence over `context_file`.
- `context_markers.start` / `.end` — the delimiters surrounding the managed section. Defaults to `<!-- SPECKIT START -->` and `<!-- SPECKIT END -->` when the field is missing.

It then creates, replaces, or appends the managed block so that the section points at the most recent plan path when one can be discovered (any `plan.md` under `specs/`, including nested scoped layouts such as `specs/<scope>/<feature>/plan.md`).

If `context_files` and `context_file` are empty, the command reports nothing to do and exits successfully. Context file paths must stay project-relative; absolute paths, Windows drive paths, backslash separators, and `..` path segments are rejected.

## Execution

- **Bash**: `.specify/extensions/agent-context/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh [plan_path]`
- **PowerShell**: `.specify/extensions/agent-context/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 [plan_path]`

When `plan_path` is omitted, the script auto-detects the most recently modified `specs/**/plan.md` (searched recursively, so nested scoped layouts are discovered).

## Required Structured Step Report

End the final response with exactly one fenced `aisdlc-step-report` JSON object:

```aisdlc-step-report
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "status": "pass|blocked|fail",
  "blocker_code": null,
  "attempted_fallbacks": [],
  "external_write": false,
  "summary": "human-readable result"
}
```

Use `null` only for a passing result. For blocked or failed results, use one of:

- `INVALID_COMPARISON_BASE`
- `UNSAFE_CHECKOUT`
- `CONTRACT_CONFLICT`
- `MISSING_SCRIPT`
- `MISSING_TEMPLATE`
- `TOOL_FAILURE`

Invoke only framework scripts declared in this command's frontmatter. Never discover,
download, install, or execute a package to replace a missing framework script.
