## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Outline

1. **Ask the user** for the feature directory path (e.g., `specs/my-feature`). Do not proceed until provided.

2. Create the directory and write `.specify/feature.json`:
   ```json
   { "feature_directory": "<feature_directory>" }
   ```

3. Create a specification from the user input and store it in `<feature_directory>/spec.md`.
   - Overview, functional requirements, user scenarios, success criteria
   - Every requirement must be testable
   - Make informed defaults for unspecified details

## Required Structured Step Report

End the final response with exactly one fenced `aisdlc-step-report` JSON object:

```aisdlc-step-report
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "status": "pass|blocked|fail",
  "blocker_code": null,
  "attempted_fallbacks": [],
  "external_write": false,
  "summary": "human-readable result"
}
```

Use `null` only for a passing result. For blocked or failed results, use one of:

- `INVALID_COMPARISON_BASE`
- `UNSAFE_CHECKOUT`
- `CONTRACT_CONFLICT`
- `MISSING_SCRIPT`
- `MISSING_TEMPLATE`
- `TOOL_FAILURE`

Invoke only framework scripts declared in this command's frontmatter. Never discover,
download, install, or execute a package to replace a missing framework script.
